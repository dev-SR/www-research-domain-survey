# Research Area/Index/Domain Identification of a Researcher

The purpose of this website is to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model for identifying the research domain of a given researcher. Through a survey, we aim to gather data and assess the accuracy of our model in correctly identifying the domain of a researcher's work. By conducting this evaluation, we hope to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our model, and identify areas for improvement in order to better support researchers in their work. This survey serves as a critical tool for improving the accuracy of domain identification in research and advancing the field of research evaluation.
